# Predicting Heart Failure with Supervised Learning Classification
Heart failure is a critical medical condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's demands. This may arise from a weakened or damaged heart muscle, resulting in diminished pumping capacity.

Project Overview
This project leverages supervised learning, a method where a model learns from labeled data, to predict the likelihood of heart failure. The output variable indicates whether a patient is at risk, categorized as "at risk of heart failure" or "not at risk of heart failure". The following features were utilized:

Age (in years)
Sex (0 for male, 1 for female)
Chest Pain Type (0 for Typical Angina, 1 for Atypical Angina, 2 for Non-Anginal Pain, 3 for Asymptomatic)
Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
Cholesterol Level (mg/dl)
Fasting Blood Sugar (0 for < 120 mg/dl, 1 for >= 120 mg/dl)
Resting Electrocardiogram (0 for Normal, 1 for Abnormality in ST-T wave, 2 for Left Ventricular Hypertrophy)
Maximum Heart Rate
Exercise-Induced Angina (0 for No, 1 for Yes)
ST Depression induced by Exercise relative to Rest
Slope of the ST Segment (0 for Upsloping, 1 for Flat, 2 for Downsloping)
Heart Disease (0 for No heart disease, 1 for Presence of heart disease)
